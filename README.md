# Algorithm
## Gathering all "Need to know" algorithm in POSN (C++)

Feel free to create new pull request
## Pull Request Rule
1. Use the provided ["Template.cpp" file](Template.cpp)
2. Implement the algorithm part in new function (main function is for i/o only)
3. return the answers from the function (not using an variable to store the answers or print them directly)
4. (Optional) If possible, please provide a explanation link (e.g. blog explained about that algorithm, geeksforgreeks etc.)
